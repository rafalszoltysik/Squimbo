# Squimbo copywriting

## Voice

You are hosting a living-room game, not selling SaaS. Short. Concrete. A little dry humor is fine; cringe is not.

## How to write

- First sentence = what to do now
- CTA: verb + object (`Start the match`, `Vote for someone`)
- Errors: what happened + what to try (`Sign-in failed. Open the Activity again.`)
- PL: write Polish from intent; do not calque English

Gameplay **prompt bodies** are not Activity chrome. Write them in `packages/db/prisma/prompt-bank.ts` per [docs/prompt-content.md](../../../docs/prompt-content.md). UI catalogs stay en+pl; the MVP prompt table stays English rows only.

## HUMAN WRITING TEST

Read it out loud. If it sounds like a landing page or like another game’s store listing pasted in, rewrite.

Facts only from [docs/product.md](../../../docs/product.md).

README and `docs/` prose: [friends-docs](../friends-docs/SKILL.md), not this skill.
